Early work in dynamic graph algorithms in the sequential setting includes the sparsification method proposed by Eppstein et al. \cite{graph-eppstein97} and Ramalingam's bounded incremental computation approach \cite{incr-ramalingam96}.\ignore{The latter advocates measuring the work done as part of the update in proportion to the effect the update has on the computation.} Several approaches have been suggested for incremental computation of approximate PageRank values in a dynamic or evolving graph. Chien et al. \cite{rank-chien01} identify a small region near updated vertices in the graph and represent the rest of the graph as a single vertex in a smaller graph. PageRanks are computed for this reduced graph and then transferred back to the original graph. Chen et al. \cite{chen2004local} propose various methods to estimate the PageRank score of a webpage using a small subgraph of the entire web, by expanding backwards from the target node along reverse hyperlinks. Bahmani et al. \cite{bahmani2010fast} analyze the efficiency of Monte Carlo methods for incremental PageRank computation. Zhan et al. \cite{zhan2019fast} introduce a Monte Carlo-based algorithm for PageRank tracking on dynamic networks, maintaining $R$ random walks starting from each node. Pashikanti et al. \cite{rank-pashikanti22} also employ a similar Monte Carlo-based approach for updating PageRank scores upon vertex and edge insertions/deletions.

A few approaches have been devised to update exact PageRank scores on dynamic graphs. Zhang \cite{rank-zhang17} introduces a simple incremental PageRank computation system for dynamic graphs, which we refer to as the \textit{Naive-dynamic} approach, on hybrid CPU and GPU platforms\ignore{ --- employing the Update-Gather-Apply-Scatter (UGAS) computation model}. Additionally, Ohsaka et al. \cite{ohsaka2015efficient} propose a method for locally updating PageRank using the Gauss-Southwell method, prioritizing the vertex with the greatest residual for initial updating; however, their algorithm is inherently sequential. A widely adopted approach for updating PageRank \cite{rank-desikan05, kim2015incremental, rank-giri20, sahu2022dynamic} is based on the observation that changes in the out-degree of a node do not influence its PageRank score, adhering to the first-order Markov property. The portion of the graph undergoing updates, involving edge insertions or deletions, is used to identify the affected region of the graph in a preprocessing step. This is typically accomplished through Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal from vertices connected to the inserted or deleted edges. Subsequently, PageRanks are computed solely for this region. Desikan et al. \cite{rank-desikan05} originally proposed this, which we term as the \textit{Dynamic Traversal} approach in this report. Kim and Choi \cite{kim2015incremental} apply this approach with an asynchronous PageRank implementation, while Giri et al. \cite{rank-giri20} utilize it with collaborative executions on multi-core CPUs and massively parallel GPUs. Sahu et al. \cite{sahu2022dynamic} employ this strategy on a Strongly Connected Component (SCC)-based graph decomposition to limit computation to reachable SCCs from updated vertices, on multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

In our previous study \cite{sahu2024incrementally}, we introduced an incrementally expanding method for updating PageRank on dynamic graphs, demonstrating strong performance on dynamic graphs derived from large static graphs with uniformly random batch updates. However, we noted that the approach did not perform as effectively on real-world dynamic graphs. Adjusting parameters, specifically lowering the frontier tolerance, was necessary to achieve decent performance. Therefore, the selection of frontier tolerance, along with the method of frontier expansion, relies on the nature of batch updates.\ignore{In this technical report, we explore how to expand the frontier, along with the choice of a suitable frontier tolerance, for real world dynamic graphs. Next, we explore how to prune processed vertices, i.e., contract the set of affected vertices, and select an appropriate prune tolerance. Our experiments on both real-world dynamic graphs and large static graphs with uniformly random batch updates demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with minor adjustments in both scenarios. Note that a batch update refers to a set of simultaneous changes, i.e., edge insertions or deletions, applied to the graph in a single step.}

Further, Bahmani et al. \cite{rank-bahmani12} introduce an algorithm for selectively crawling a small section of the web to estimate the true PageRank of the graph at a given moment, while Berberich et al. \cite{rank-berberich07} propose a method to compute normalized PageRank scores that remain robust against non-local changes in the graph. These approaches diverge from our improved \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach, which concentrates on computing the PageRank vector itself rather than on the tasks of web crawling or maintaining normalized scores.

% Note that as originally conceived, the PageRank model does not factor a web browser's \textbf{back button} into a surfer's hyperlinking possibilities. Surfers in one class, if teleporting, may be much more likely to jump to pages about sports, while surfers in another class may be much more likely to jump to pages pertaining to news and current events. Such differing teleportation tendencies can be captured in two different \textbf{personalization vectors}. However, it makes the once query-independent, user independent PageRankings, user-dependent and more calculation-laden. Nevertheless, it seems this little personalization vector has had more significant side effects. This personalization vector, along with a \textbf{non-uniform/weighted} version of PageRank \cite{pr-dubey16} can help control spamming done by the so-called link farms \cite{pr-deeper01}.

% Techniques to optimize the PageRank algorithm usually fall in two categories. One is to try \textbf{reducing the work per iteration}, and the other is to try \textbf{reducing the number of iterations}. Often, these goals are at odds against each other. The \textbf{adapting PageRank technique} "locks" vertices which have converged, and saves iteration time by skipping their computation \cite{pr-deeper01}. Identical nodes, which have the same in-links, can be removed to reduce duplicate computations and thus reduce iteration time. Road networks often have chains which can be short-circuited before PageRank computation to improve performance. Final ranks of chain nodes can be easily calculated. This reduces both the iteration time, and the number of iterations. If a graph has no dangling nodes, PageRank of each strongly connected component can be computed in topological order. This helps reduce the iteration time, number of iterations, and also enable concurrency in PageRank computation. The combination of all of the above methods is the \textbf{STIC-D algorithm} (see Figure \ref{fig:about-pagerank-sticd}) \cite{pr-sticd16}. A somewhat similar aggregation algorithm is \textbf{BlockRank} which computes the PageRank of hosts, local PageRank of pages within hosts independently, and aggregates them with weights for the final rank vector. The ranks of vertices for the entire graph can be found efficiently by computing the sub-PageRank of each connected component, and then using the sub-PageRanks together to form the global PageRank (Avrachenkov et. al. \cite{pr-avrachenkov04}). These methods exploit the inherent reducibility in the graph. The \textbf{Jacobi method} can also be used to compute the PageRank vector (Bianchini et. al. \cite{pr-bianchini05}) \cite{pr-deeper01}. \textbf{Monte Carlo} based PageRank methods consider several random walks on the input graph to get approximate PageRanks. Its optimizations for distributed PageRank computation (specially for undirected graphs) \cite{compute-frey13}, map-reduce algorithm for personalized PageRank \cite{pr-bahmani11}, and reordering strategy (to reduce space and compute complexity on GPU) for local PageRank \cite{pr-lai17} are present.

% The time per iteration can be reduced further by taking note of the fact that the traditional algorithm is \textbf{not computationally bound} and \textbf{generates fine granularity random accesses} (it exhibits irregular parallelism). This causes poor memory bandwidth and compute utilization, and the extent of this is quite dependent upon the graph structure \cite{compute-hunold15} \cite{pr-lakhotia18}. \textit{Four strategies for neighbour iteration} were attempted, to help reason about the \textit{expected impact of a graph's structure} on the performance of each strategy \cite{compute-hunold15}. CPUs/GPUs are generally designed optimized to \textbf{load memory} in blocks (cache-lines in CPUs, coalesced memory reads in GPUs), and not for fine-grained accesses. Being able to adjust this behaviour depending upon application (PageRank) can lead to performance improvements. Techniques like \textit{prefetching to SRAM, using a high-performance shuffle network} \cite{graph-wang15}, \textit{indirect memory prefetcher (of the form $A[B[i]]$), partial cache line accessing mechanisms} \cite{memory-yu15}, \textit{adjusting data layout} \cite{pr-lakhotia18} \textit{(for sequential DRAM access} \cite{pr-zhou15} \textit{), and branch avoidance mechanisms (with partitioning)} \cite{pr-lakhotia18} are used. Large graphs can be \textbf{partitioned }or decomposed into subgraphs to help reduce cross-partition data access that helps both in distributed, as well as shared memory systems (by reducing random accesses). Techniques like \textit{chunk partitioning} \cite{pr-rungsawang12}, \textit{cache/propagation blocking} \cite{pr-beamer17}, \textit{partition-centric processing with gather-apply-scatter model} \cite{pr-lakhotia18}, \textit{edge-centric scatter-gather with non-overlapping vertex-set} \cite{pr-zhou17}, \textit{exploiting node-score sparsity} \cite{pr-li21}, and even \textit{personalized PageRank based partitioning} \cite{pr-mazaheri19} have been used. Graph/subgraph \textbf{compression} can also help reduce memory bottlenecks \cite{pr-rungsawang12} \cite{pr-guoqiang20}, and enable processing of larger graphs in memory. A number of techniques can be used to compress adjacency lists, such as, \textit{delta encoding of edge/neighbour ids} \cite{graph-bharat98}, and \textit{referring sets of edges in edge lists} \cite{graph-adler01} \cite{graph-raghavan03} (hard to find reference vertices though) \cite{pr-deeper01}. Since the rank vector (possibly even including certain additional page-importance estimates) must reside entirely in main memory, a few compression techniques have been attempted. These include \textit{lossy encoding schemes based on scalar quantization} seeking to minimize the distortion of search-result rankings \cite{pr-haveliwala02} \cite{pr-deeper01}, and using \textit{custom half-precision floating-point formats} \cite{pr-molahosseini20}.

% As new software/hardware \textbf{platforms} appear on the horizon, researchers have been eager to test the performance of PageRank on the hardware. This is because each platform offers its own unique architecture and engineering choices, and also because PageRank often serves as a good benchmark for the capability of the platform to handle various other graph algorithms. Attempts have been made on distributed frameworks like \textit{Hadoop} \cite{pr-abdullah10}, and even \textit{RDBMS} \cite{compute-barolli21}. A number of implementations have been done on \textit{standard multicores} \cite{compute-barolli21}, \textit{Cell BE} \cite{compute-buehrer08} \cite{pr-zhou17}, \textit{AMD GPUs} \cite{pr-wu10}, \textit{NVIDIA/CUDA GPUs} \cite{pr-bisson16} \cite{pr-zhou17} \cite{graph-seo15}, \textit{GPU clusters} \cite{pr-rungsawang12}, \textit{FPGAs} \cite{pr-mughrabi21} \cite{graph-wang15} \cite{pr-guoqiang20}, \textit{CPU-FPGA hybrids} \cite{pr-hassan21} \cite{pr-usta21} \cite{pr-li21}, and even on SpMV \textit{ASICs} \cite{pr-sadi18}.

% PageRank algorithm is a \textbf{live algorithm} which means that an ongoing computation can be paused during graph update, and simply be resumed afterwards (instead of restarting it). The first \textbf{updating} paper by Chien et al. \cite{pr-chien01} identifies a tiny region of the graph near the changed vertices/edges and model the remainder of the graph as a single vertex in a new, much smaller graph. PageRanks are computed for the small graph and then transferred to the original graph \cite{pr-deeper01}. A common technique used for dynamic PageRank algorithm, given a small change to the input graph, is to find the affected region in the preprocessing step with breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) traversal from the vertices connecting the edges that were inserted or deleted \cite{pr-desikan05} \cite{pr-giri20}.

  % \multicolumn{3}{|p{14cm}|}{This paper describes a technique to partition the link file of the whole file into blocks of a range of destination nodes, with partial source nodes, so that it is possible to run power iteration of pagerank of massive graphs which do not fit in memory. The graphs must be stored on disk, and partitions of the graphs are scanned in every iteration until the ranks converge. Unlike Haveliwala's technique, this is similar to pull based pagerank. Both methods have similarities with join techniques in database systems. Topic-sensitive pagerank is also discussed which finds pagerank of graphs related to a specific keywords beforehand, and merges them together based upon the query (might return better results than global pagerank). This requires small adjustments to the random jump probability factor $(1-d)$. \footnote{https://gist.github.com/wolfram77/925cede0214aa0f391f34fa8ce137290}} \\ \hline

  % \multicolumn{3}{|p{14cm}|}{In this paper, the authors exploit the reducibility of dead-end free graphs to compute PageRanks. They first split the vertices into strongly connected components (SCCs) and represent each SCC as a vertex in a block-graph. Each SCC is then processed as per its topological order in the block-graph. This enables them to reduce the operating memory requirement, thanks to the smaller size of SCCs that are processed in one go. As SCCs are processed in topological order, unnecessary iterations on vertices that are unlikely to converge are avoided. Processing vertices grouped into SCCs also improves performance due to inherent spatial locality within an SCC. In addition, this method allows SCCs residing on the same level in the block-graph to be processed independently of each other. This is demonstrated by the authors by processing each such SCC in parallel with OpenMP. They also present three algorithmic techniques for eliminating redundancies in PageRank computation, namely skipping repeated computation on in-identical vertices (minimize redundant computation), short circuiting chain vertices (help accelerate convergence), and skipping computation on vertices that appear to have converged (minimize redundant computation).The suitability of these techniques depend upon the nature of input graph. They study the techniques on four classes of real-world graphs: web graphs, social networks, citation and collaboration networks, and road networks. Their implementation achieves an average speedup of 32\% compared to a baseline implementation. \footnote{https://gist.github.com/wolfram77/bb09968cc0e592583c4b180243697d5a}} \\ \hline

% Coarse PageRank approaches: Arasu et al. \cite{rank-arasu02} proposed HostRank, where the web is aggregated at the level of host names. BlockRank \cite{kamvar2003exploiting} uses HostRank to initialize PageRank, while DirRank \cite{rank-eiron04} forms aggregation at the level of directories of websites.

%% We use an asynchronous approach:
% Real-Time PageRank on Dynamic Graphs (2023): In this paper, Sallinen et al. \cite{sallinen2023real} compute PageRank asynchronously for real-time, on demand PageRank computation with arbitrary granularity. They model PageRank as a flow problem, where mass is absorbed by the page, and the rest is distributed to neighbors. This is done by sending delta values of probability mass depending on edge deletion or insertions by adjustment upon earlier values. Sink/dangling vertices (dead ends) are handled as usual (teleport).

%% Interesting approach:
% PageRank Algorithm Based on Dynamic Damping Factor (2023): Existing methods often set the damping factor empirically, overlooking the relevance of web visitors’ topics. HaoLin et al. \cite{haolin2023pagerank} propose an adaptive dynamic damping factor based on the web browsing context, and demonstrate that it effectively mitigates the impact of noisy web pages on query results and improves the convergence speed.

%% Sliding window approach.
% Time-Aware Ranking in Dynamic Citation Networks (2011): In this paper, Ghosh et al. \cite{ghosh2011time} consider the temporal order of links and chains of links connecting to a node with some temporal decay factors, and show that it is more appropriate for predicting future citations and PageRank scores with regard to new citations.

%% Other interesting approach:
% A Dynamical System for PageRank with Time-Dependent Teleportation (2014): In this paper, Gleich and Rossi \cite{gleich2014dynamical} propose a time-dependent teleportation to the PageRank score. The magnitude of the deviation from a static PageRank vector is given by a PageRank problem with complex-valued teleportation parameters. They demonstrate the utility of dynamic teleportation on both the article graph of Wikipedia, where the external interest information is given by the number of hourly visitors to each page, and the Twitter social network, where external interest is the number of tweets per month. They show that using information from the dynamical system helps improve a prediction task and identify trends in the data.

%% Other interesting approach:
% Temporal PageRank (2016): In this paper, Rozenshtein and Gionis \cite{rozenshtein2016temporal} propose an extension of static PageRank to temporal PageRank so that only temporal walks are considered instead of all possible walks. In order to compute temporal PageRank we need to process the sequence of interactions and calculate the weighted number of temporal walks. Their algorithm counts explicitly the weighted number of temporal walks.

%% Similar to STIC-D:
% Divide and conquer approach for efficient pagerank computation (2006): In this paper, Desikan et al. \cite{desikan2006divide} propose a graph-partitioning technique for PageRank, on which computation can be performed independently.

%% Similar to STIC-D:
% A componentwise PageRank algorithm (2015): In this paper, Engstrom et al. \cite{engstrom2015componentwise} propose two PageRank algorithms, one similar to the Lumping algorithm proposed by Qing et al. which handles certain types of vertices faster, and last, another PageRank algorithm which can handle more types of vertices as well as strongly connected components more effectively. This is similar to the work of Garg et al.

%% Streaming PageRank:
% Estimating PageRank on graph streams (2011): In this paper, Sarma et al. \cite{rank-sarma11} study the streaming model for PageRank, which uses a small amount of memory (preferably sub-linear in the number of nodes n). They compute approximate PageRank values in Õ(nM−1/4) space and Õ(M3/4) passes. They also give another approach to approximate the PageRank values in just Õ(1) passes although this requires Õ(nM) space.

%% Applications of PageRank:
% PageRank Tracker: From Ranking to Tracking (2013): PageRank has been used by Gong et al. \cite{gong2013pagerank} in video object tracking to improve its robustness, i.e., to address difficulties with adaptation to environmental or target change. Determining the target is equivalent to finding the unlabeled sample that is the most associated with the existing labeled set.

%% Applications of PageRank:
% Abstracting PageRank To Dynamic Asset Valuation (2006): In this paper, Sawilla \cite{sawilla2006abstracting} uses (weighted) PageRank to quickly and dynamically calculate a relative value for all assets in an organization in any context in which dependencies may be specified. Their scheme works in general and will provide asset valuation in any context, be it confidentiality, integrity, availability, or even political capital.

%% For introduction, also a bit here:
% Adaptive Implementation to Update Page Rank on Dynamic Networks (2021): In this oral presentation, Srinivasan \cite{srinivasan2021adaptive} talk about the fact that There are a lot of attempts made to parallelize the page rank algorithm for static networks, however, there are only very few attempts made to compute page rank on dynamic networks. As the networks change with time, computing page rank or updating is an expensive operation, the previous attempts have only approximated the metric to avoid recomputation. In this paper, we introduce a framework where we try to update the page rank of the vertices which embraces change as the network changes. The proposed framework is implemented on a shared memory system and experiments on real-world and synthetic networks show good scalability. The framework proposed gets an input set of networks, initial page rank values for all the vertices, and a set of batches that has the changeset. As the batches are processed in parallel, affected vertices are identified and marked for an update, once the batch is processed the vertices affected or identified their page rank values are computed. The main contribution of this paper is the proposed framework avoids recomputation of all vertices, and only recomputes few vertices, and avoids approximation to provide accurate values.
