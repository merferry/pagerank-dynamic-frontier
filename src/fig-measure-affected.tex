\caption{Average percentage of vertices marked as affected by \textit{Dynamic Traversal} and \textit{Dynamic Frontier} PageRank, with batch size increasing from $10^{-7} |E|$ to $0.1 |E|$ in multiples of $10$ (logarithmic scale), consisting purely of edge insertions. The \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach marks affected vertices incrementally --- thus, the final percentage (at the end of all iterations) is depicted here.}
