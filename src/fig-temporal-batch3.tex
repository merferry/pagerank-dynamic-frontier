  \caption{Average Relative runtime with asynchronous implementations of \textit{Static}, \textit{Naive-dynamic}, \textit{Dynamic Traversal}, and \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approach compared to their respective synchronous implementations, on batch updates of size $10^{-7}|E|$ to $0.1|E|$ (right), and overall (left). The results indicate that asynchronous implementations are faster than synchronous ones, especially for smaller batch sizes. This is due to a somewhat faster convergence and the absence of copy overhead (for \textit{Dynamic Traversal} and \textit{Dynamic Frontier} approaches).}
