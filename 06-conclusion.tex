In conclusion, this study presents an efficient algorithm for updating PageRank on dynamic graphs. Given a batch update of edge insertions and deletions, our Dynamic Frontier approach identifies an initial set of affected vertices and incrementally expands this set through iterations. On a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, Dynamic Frontier PageRank outperforms Static, Naive-dynamic, and Dynamic Traversal PageRank by $8.3\times$, $2.7\times$, and $3.4\times$ respectively for uniformly random batch updates of size $10^{-7}|E|$ to $10^{-3}|E|$ with purely edge insertions; $7.4\times$, $3.1\times$, and $4.1\times$ respectively for purely edge deletion updates; and $7.6\times$, $2.8\times$, and $4.1\times$ for updates consisting of an $80\%$ - $20\%$ mix of insertions and deletions. Additionally, the approach exhibits a performance improvement of $1.8\times$ for each doubling of threads. On temporal graphs, we observe that lowering $\tau_f$ to $\tau / 10$ or $\tau / 100$ is needed for Dynamic Frontier PageRank to achieve food performance. Thus, a suitable choice of $\tau_f$ and how the frontier of affected vertices expands depend on the batch update's nature. We plan to explore this in the future.
